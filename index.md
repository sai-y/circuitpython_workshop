## Citizen Science With MicroPython
Thanks for signing up for the workshop. We are DIY enthusiasts and big fans of the Micropython world. We put this workshop together to share our knowledge with others. This workshop is by no means a comprehensive guide to Micropython but the contents in the workshop should get you started with collecting simple data points using MicroPython. 

# Documentation

The official documentation for running the MicroPython on the ESP8266 is available from [here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html).
